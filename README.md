Connect your Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or 3.3V/5V device to 5-24V signals safely. Complete isolation Great for level shifting from 5V to 3.3V as well. Looking to connect a microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino to high-voltage or loud signals? Look nowhere else!

This 4-channel & 8-channel input opt isolator board produces clean, regulated 3.3-5V signals on the output side and accepts nominal voltages of 5Â­-24V (maximum of 40V) on the input side. A LOW/grounded state fed into an input will result in a LOW/wrecked state on the output, and vice versa. This board is simple to use because of its big screw terminals, obvious LED state indicators, and optional 2.54mm headers.
